#Digiwom

Hello to the Read Me files.

Digicom code at the moment is being refracted. Due to the fact that it was started on pure php and logic was not clear so it is being moved to symfony so we can use the mvc pattern. This is the code that supports the betta app and code is messy due to the fact that we received functionality requests with delay and we had to manage thing in a hurry.
